💧 Simple Cost Behavior Model
The purpose of this model is to show, in a simplified approach, how costs behave.

 📃 Despite having some technicalities that are hardly useful for general business entusiasts, Accounting (specially managerial) has some very meaningful insights. Understanding Costs Behavior is definetely one of them, and can give an excellent idea of how net income is "made". 
  
This project brings to the table 3 important concepts:

❇️ Variable Costs: As the name implies, it "varies" proportionally to level of activity. It is cost associated to each product. For instance, the tissue used to manufacture a shirt. 

❇️ Fixed Costs: They exist regardless of the level of activity (e.g., rent).

❇️ Contribution Margin: It is what is left from Income after total variable costs (unitary variable cost * quantity of products) are deducted. It will be used to cover fixed costs. If greater than fixed costs, net income will be generated. Otherwise, net loss.

# Acknowledgements 

🔹 This project was inspired by Professor Marilson Dantas at the University of Brasília, and the theoretical concepts were borrowed from Garrison's Managerial Accounting book.
